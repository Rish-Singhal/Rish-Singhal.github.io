    <p>
      <em>Set with Friends</em> is a web implementation of a real-time pattern
      matching card game called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a>.
      Originally, when I was at
      <a href="https://sparc-camp.org/">SPARC 2019</a>, I wondered how I could
      bridge the 3000 mile gap between some of the friends I had made after we
      parted ways. <em>Set with Friends</em> lets you play Set online with
      minimal overhead (no login necessary); it's as simple as sharing a custom
      link and having fun!

      During the design process, I learned about Firebase (a service offered by
      Google), so for me this became an introduction to serverless
      architectures, as well as an exercise in creating live interfaces. We
      completely overhauled the design in May and released version 2.0 in June.
      At the time of writing (July 2020), the website has over 40000 monthly
      active users and 5000 games played every day.
