      A competitive programmer's library of algorithms and data structures in
      C++.
    </p>
    <p>
      I maintain an open-source library of about thirty-five C++ templates for
      algorithms and data structures. These are not your typical algorithms from
      school; I focused on complex algorithms useful for advanced competitive
      programmers. These include fast implementations of FFT, Aho-Corasick, and
      Dinic, as well as data structures like Link-Cut Trees and Centroid
      Decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is accessible on a website, which I developed using Angular and the
      GitHub API. The website also includes a searchable collection of more than
      600 templates from other open-source competitive programming libraries.
