      An online, cloud-synchronized workspace for competitive programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top competitive programmers have dedicated setups on their local machines
      that let them quickly creating new programs from templates, generate input
      files, and run code on suites of test data. But what if you're working on
      a different computer, and you don't have all these tools installed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Workspace</em> is a side-by-side problem viewer and code editor that
      allows you to run code online. It even has advanced features like
      autocompletion and automatically parses of test cases for each problem, so
      you don't need to manually insert these yourself. This was inspired by
      <a href="https://csacademy.com/">CS Academy</a>'s interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      To accomplish this, the web server lets you scrape problems from online
      judges at the click of a button. All code is automatically saved and
      synchronized with a MongoDB instance in the cloud, so it persists across
      sessions and browsers. See the website below to try it out.
